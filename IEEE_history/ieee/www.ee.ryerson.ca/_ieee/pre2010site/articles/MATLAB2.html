              <BR>
Though MATLAB accepts commands interactively, you can create a file that contains MATLAB commands and then you can ask MATLAB to execute these commands without entering them interactively like you've seen in the Getting Started part of this tutorial. This kind of file is called a <I> script </I> or <I> M-File </I>. The name M-file is due to the fact that all script file names must be of the form "filename.m". Once a script file has been created and prepared, the commands contained in it can be executed simply by entering the name of the file, without the .m, at the MATLAB prompt. To create M-Files, either use a conventional word processor like jedit, or emacs on Unix Stations or use Notepad in Windows and save the extension of the file as '.m', or you can simply use the M-File editor that is provided with MATLAB when you install the program. Make sure you change the current working directory MATLAB is working in before executing the script command for your M-file or it won't recognize it.<BR>
<BR>
Let's take an example. Suppose I declare a whole slew of variables: A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H. I'm going to do some simple operations to these, like adding and subtracting and what not. Instead of declaring and initializing all of these in the MATLAB command window, I can write this simple set of operations in an M-File, then simply invoke what your program is called, without the .m, and away you go.<BR>
<BR>
Creating an M-File is pretty much how you would type stuff into the command console. Each line is run once, depending on how the program is structured, it may go back and run stuff again due to how you programmed it. We'll get into this later. It does, however, run through each line in a linear fashion. Let's suppose I do this, we'll name our M-File <I>temp.m</I>, and in this M-File it will contain the following:<BR>
<BR>
A = 1;<BR>
B = 2;<BR>
C = 3;<BR>
D = 4; <BR>
<BR>
E = C + D<BR>
F = B - C<BR>
G = A / B<BR>
H = A * B<BR>
<BR>
Note that some commands have semicolons, whereas others have no semicolons. The reason is, is because as MATLAB runs through each line, if you remember from the Getting Started part of the tutorial, the semicolon hides the output of the command you just invoked, whereas if a semi-colon were absent, you'd see the result of what you just put in. So, initializing A, B, C, D, you won't see any output to the screen. E, F, G and H, you will see output.<BR>
<BR>
Now, we'll save this, then we'll assume that <I>temp.m</I> is in a directory that MATLAB is currently working in. When we type in <I>temp</I> into the console window, we thus see this:<BR>
<BR>
>> temp <- Press Enter<BR>
<BR>
E = <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7<BR>
<BR>
F = <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-1<BR>
<BR>
G = <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.5000<BR>
<BR>
H = <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<BR>
<BR>
The advantage of using a script file is that a problem can be resolved for different variable values, or you can use different algorithms just by modifying the script file. There is no need to enter ALL the MATLAB commands again.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF = "#home">top</A><BR>
<BR>
<a name="FuncnScript"></a> <B><I><U> Function Script Files</u></i></B><BR>
<BR>
MATLAB functions are similar to subroutines that you'd see in other conventional programming languages, like C for example. These are defined in what is called <I> function script files </I> or <I> function m-files</I>. These are also saved as .m files, but their main difference would be that a function script file communications with the MATLAB workspace only through the input variables passed to it and through the output variables that it passes back. Other variables created within the function do not interact with the MATLAB workspace. These are local variables which are local to a function, which is just how a subroutine works in C. A MATLAB function is defined by creating a function m-file. Creating this is exactly the same way as creating any other standard .m file by either using the M-File editor, or by using a conventional word processor and renaming the file with an extension of .m.<BR>
<BR>
There are two exceptions to the similarities of a function .m file, and a standard .m file. That is, the name of a function m-file must be the same as the name of the function itself. Secondly, the first line of a function m-file must be used to specify the name of the function and its input and output variables, and must be the following form:<BR>
<BR>
function [output1, output2,..., outputn] = function_name(input1, input2, ..., inputn)<BR>
<BR>
The keyword <I>function</I> specifies that this is a function m-file. input1, input2, etc. etc. are the input variables to the function, and output1, output2, etc. etc. are the output variables of the function. Note that there are square braces for the output variables, and there are normal braces for the input variables, and remember that function_name is the name of your particular function you wish to implement, and don't forget to save your m-file the same name you named your function.<BR>
<BR>
Let's do an example. Let's modify the script program above. Let's change it so that A, B, C and D are not initialized and are input variables to the function. E, F, G, and H are still output variables. We'll call this particular function <I>temp</I>. So, let's modify this so that it acts as a function rather than a series of events.<BR>
<BR>
function [E, F, G, H] = temp(A, B, C, D)<BR>
E = C + D<BR>
F = B - C<BR>
G = A / B<BR>
H = A * B<BR>
<BR>
Note that now, A, B, C, D are input parameters. A, B, C and D are now merely placeholders to the fields that you put in when you invoke this temp function. Let us assume now that we've saved this and overwritten what we had previously, that is, we'll save this as <I>temp.m</I>. Now, let's get back to the MATLAB command window. Assume that we're in the working directory such that <I>temp.m</I> is located.<BR>
<BR>
We know invoke the function to the command line window with inputs 1, 2, 3 and 4.<BR>
<BR>
>> temp(1, 2, 3, 4) <- Press Enter<BR>
<BR>
E = <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7<BR>
<BR>
F = <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-1<BR>
<BR>
G = <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.5000<BR>
<BR>
H = <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<BR>
<BR>
Now, when we look at the function script file above, its methods for passing parameters between subroutines is just the same as any conventional programming language. A is then assigned to 1, B is assigned to 2, C is assigned to 3, and finally D is assigned to 4. Note that it's the same output as earlier, we've just modified it so that it is now a function. Now, instead of editing the MATLAB script file every time, you can declare as a function, and just change the parameters and depending on the parameters, it will then give you your specified output. This is even easier than the last time.<BR>
<BR>
One thing you have to be careful of, however, is the scope of variables. Once the function is finished executing, all variables internal to the function are then lost. You are not able to access them once the function is finished, that is, the variables the passed in - A, B, C, D - and the variables that are outputted - E, F, G, H - are not accessible by MATLAB's command line window. If you try to access them, it will give you an error stating that the variable is undefined.<BR>
<BR>
You could also prompt the user for input too, which is pretty cool in itself. In your function m-file, you could prompt the user by using the <I> input </I> command. For example, let's say we do this:<BR>
<BR>
Value = input('Enter value of Value: ')<BR>
<BR>
This then makes MATLAB print the text string <I>Enter value of Value</I> and then waits for input from the keyboard. The value of the input obtained is then assigned to Value.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF = "#home">top</A><BR>
<BR>
<a name="ForLoops"></a> <B><I><U> For Loops</u></i></B><BR>
<BR>
In function script files, not only can the m-file act like a subroutine, but it can also take in some conventional programming constructs that you're familiar with. Again, this guide assumes that you have a basic understanding of how programming constructs work. You are advised to review how they work by going to the tutorials provided at the <I>Before we start</I> sidelink on the side bar should have forgotten or have no knowledge at all on how they work.<BR>
<BR>
For loops allow a group of MATLAB commands to be executed repeatedly for a predetermined number of times. A for loop has the following structure:<BR>
<BR>
for i = any_array<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commands<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
end<BR>
<BR>
Don't forget the end statement after your for loop. any_array means an array, which can be a row or column vector. any_array specifies how many times your loop will be executed, this being the lower, and upper bounds of the loop, as well as defining in what increments the loop will execute. Note that there are no square braces enclosing any_array.<BR>
<BR>
any_array can take two forms:<BR>
<BR>
<I> lower:higher </I><-- the loop will then execute from the lower bound, to the higher bound, in increments of 1.<BR>
<I>lower:increment:higher</I> <-- the loop will then execute from the lower bound, to the higher bound in increments of 'increment'.<BR>
<BR>
So for example, if we did this:<BR>
<BR>
for i = 0:2<BR>
<BR>
This would have the for loop go from 0 to 2, in steps of 1 where i is the controlling variable. If we had<BR>
<BR>
for i = 0:2:8<BR>
<BR>
This would have the for loop go from 0 to 8, in steps of 2, where i is also the controlling variable. Let's do an example.<BR>
<BR>
Let's say we wanted to find the factorial of a certain number. We'll assume that we're in a working directory such that this program will be here and we'll call this m-file: <I>factorial.m</I>. The program would thus be structured like this:<BR>
<BR>
function [f] = factorial(n)<BR>
f = 1;<BR>
for i = 1:n<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f = f*i;<BR>
end;<BR>
<BR>
Let's take a look at the structure. First our m-file declares that this is a function m-file from the keyword <I>function</I>. f is our output variable, n is our input variable, and factorial is the name of our function, which is also the name of the m-file. We first declare a variable called f and initialize it to 1. We know execute a for loop. This for loop will execute n times, since we're starting from the lower bound of 1, and going up to n inclusive in increments of 1. Now let's take a look at the body of the for loop. Everytime the for loop is executed, it will then multiply itself by the variable i. It will then continue this until we have reached the higher bound of n. So if we were to input the number 4, the output would then be:<BR>
<BR>
>> factorial(4) <-- Press Enter<BR>
<BR>
ans = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24<BR>
<BR>
Which is thus the definition of a factorial.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF = "#home">top</A><BR>
<BR>
<a name="WhileLoops"></a> <B><I><U> While Loops</u></i></B><BR>
<BR>
while loops allow a group of commands to be executed indefinitely until some condition has been met, or some condition fails. The structure of a while loop is:<BR>
<BR>
while expression<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commands<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
end<BR>
<BR>
The commands between the <I>while</I> and <I>end</I> statements are executed until <I>expression</I> is evaluated to a zero value, or false. To be more specific, this while loop will keep executing as long as <I> expression</I> is evaluated as true. You can use relational of equality operators, which are often used in the <I>expression</I> of a <I>while</I> loop. A relational or equality expression will be assigned a value of 1 if it is true, and a value of 0 of it is false. You can also have logical operators in MATLAB for decision making as well. A summary of all of these are listed below:<BR>
<BR>

Let's do an example. Let's modify the factorial program we just saw above so that a while loop is implemented.<BR>
<BR>
function [f] = factorial(n)<BR>
f = 1;<BR>
i = 1;<BR>
while i <= n<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f = f*i;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i = i + 1;<BR>
end;<BR>
<BR>
It's still doing the same thing as the for loop. It checks to see if the condition i <= n is true. If it is, execute the body of the while loop, which will be multiplying the current value of f by i, then rewriting it into f, and incrementing i by 1. It will then continue until the <I>expression</I> evalutes as false, and then break out of the loop. You still get the same output as if you implemented a for loop there.<BR>

<a name="IfElsif"></a> <B><I><U> If-Else and Else-If Statements</u></i></B><BR>
<BR>
In MATLAB, decision making in MATLAB is often implemented using the if-else and else-if statements. The syntax for an if-else statement is<BR>
<BR>
if expression<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commands to be executed if expression is true<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
else<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commands to be executed if expression is false<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
<BR>
The else part is optional and can be left out if necessary. Multiple decisions can be made using the if-else and else-if statements:<BR>
<BR>
if exp1<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commands to be executed if exp1 is true<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
elseif exp2<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commands to be executed if exp2 is true<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
elseif exp3<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commands to be executed if exp3 is true<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
...<BR>
else<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commands to be executed if none of the above is true<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
end<BR>
<BR>
Let's do an example. Let's do a calendar program. This program will take in a number, and corresponding month relating to that number will be given as output. So 1 is January, 2 is February and so on and so forth. We can implement this with a series of if statements. We'll call this function m-file<I>calendar.m</I> and assume we're in a working directory such that this program is stored here. Let's tackle it.<BR>
<BR>
function [out] = calendar(month)<BR>
out = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0];<BR>
<BR>
if month == 1<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = January; <BR>
<BR>
elseif month == 2<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = February; <BR>
<BR>
elseif month == 3<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = March; <BR>
<BR>
elseif month == 4<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = April; <BR>
<BR>
elseif month == 5<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = May; <BR>
<BR>
elseif month == 6<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = June; <BR>
<BR>
elseif month == 7<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = July; <BR>
<BR>
elseif month == 8<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = August; <BR>
<BR>
elseif month == 9<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = September; <BR>
<BR>
elseif month == 10<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = October; <BR>
<BR>
elseif month == 11<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = November; <BR>
<BR>
elseif month == 12<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = December; <BR>
<BR>
else<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;error('Invalid Month. Please try again.')<BR>
<BR>
end<BR>
<BR>
Let's take a look at this program in detail. I declared <I> out </I> to be an 8 element wide vector. The reason is, is that we will store the name of the month that we're looking into the vector <I>out</I>. We can use a vector in MATLAB not only to store numbers, but characters as well. Each element in this vector will correspond to a single character. Taking in <I> month </I> as input, these if statements will check the value of month to all these expressions until it finds a case where the expression is true. Once it finds that particular expression to be true, it will then execute the body of that statement. If it doesn't find any matches, we will then write an error statement saying that it's an invalid choice. The <I> error </I> command writes to the command window telling the user that there was an error using the function that was just invoked and the message between the quotations will be displayed after.<BR>
<BR>
Supposing you wanted to input the number 5 into this function, we would then do this<BR>
<BR>
>> calendar(5)<BR>
<BR>
ans = <BR>
<BR>
May<BR>
<BR>
Supposing we put in a number that isn't between 1 to 12, we would then get this message<BR>
<BR>
>> calendar(20)<BR>
<BR>
??? Error using ==> calendar<BR>
Invalid Month. Please try again<BR>
<BR>
Not too bad no?<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF = "#home">top</A><BR>
<BR>
<a name="Switch"></a> <B><I><U> Switch-Case-Otherwise Statement</u></i></B><BR>
<BR>
The switch-case-otherwise statement is a special case of the if statement. If we know the amount of possible choices in a program which we can take, we can use the switch statement. The case statement is used in terms of choosing between a known number of selections rather than the if statement. The switch-case-otherwise statement tests each expression until it finds a match from these set of choices. It then branches to that particular choice accordingly. It has the following structure:<BR>
<BR>
switch expr<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case value1,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commands to be executed if the value of expr equals value1<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case value2,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commands to be executed if the value of expr equals value2<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commands to be executed if the value of expr is not<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equal to any of the above values<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end<BR>
<BR>
Note that expr can be a string, or a number. Let's do an example. Let's modify our calendar program so that we use case statements. It would then be modified as follows:<BR>
<BR>
function [out] = calendar(month)<BR>
out = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0];<BR>
<BR>
switch month<BR>
case 1, <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = January; <BR>
<BR>
case 2<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = February; <BR>
<BR>
case 3<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = March; <BR>
<BR>
case 4<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = April; <BR>
<BR>
case 5<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = May; <BR>
<BR>
case 6<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = June; <BR>
<BR>
case 7<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = July; <BR>
<BR>
case 8<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = August; <BR>
<BR>
case 9<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = September; <BR>
<BR>
case 10<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = October; <BR>
<BR>
case 11<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = November; <BR>
<BR>
case 12<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out = December; <BR>
<BR>
otherwise,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;error('Invalid Month. Please Try Again')<BR>
<BR>
end<BR>
<BR>
You can check yourself. This produces the same output as the calendar program using if statements<BR>
<BR>
Not too bad.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF = "#home">top</A><BR>
<BR>
<a name="Break"></a> <B><I><U> Break Command</u></i></B><BR>
<BR>
The Break Commond is often used with <I>for</I> and <I>while</I> loops. It used to cause an immediate unconditional termination of for and while loops. If a break command is used in nested loops, it causes termination of the inner most loop only. To take an example, let's take a look at our factorial program.<BR>
<BR>
If we were to insert a break statement at the end of the for loop:<BR>
<BR>
function [f] = factorial(n)<BR>
f = 1;<BR>
for i = 1:n<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f = f*i;<BR>
break<BR>
end;<BR>
<BR>
It would then execute the loop only once, and then break free from the loop and end the program. So if the value of 3 were to be entered into the program, the value that will be outputted to the screen would be simply 3. It does not compute the full factorial.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<a name="Practical"></a> <B><I><U> Practical Program</u></i></B><BR>
<BR>
I will end this tutorial by giving you an example of a practical program that you might use later in the future. Let's suppose you have a string of resistors in parallel, and you wish to find the parallel equivalent of these resistors. Kirchoff's equivalent resistor law that deals with parallel resistors is:<BR>
<BR>
1 / Req = (1 / R1) + (1 / R2) + ... + (1 / Rn)<BR>
<BR>
It's rather troublesome to do this using the interactive method in MATLAB by typing in all the variable values in and performing the operations yourself through the command line window. I'll opt to use a function m-file instead. We'll call this function m-file <I>parallel.m</I> and yes, we'll assume that we're in a working directory such that this program will be saved here.<BR>
<BR>
There are two ways you could possibly implement this program. You could either do a for loop, or a while loop. I'll show you the for loop first. Before we start, the input to this function will be an n element wide vector. For example, let's say we have 4 resistors in parallel, which are 2 Ohm, 3 Ohm, 5 Ohm and 7 Ohm respectively. You would then declare a vector to have all these elements in there. So for example, we could declare a vector R and it will have [2 3 5 7]. Anyway, the structure of the program is as follows:<BR>
<BR>
function [Req] = parallel(R)<BR>
no_of_elements = length(R);<BR>
Req = 0;<BR>
for i = 1:no_of_elements<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspRtemp = 1 / R(i);<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspReq = Req + Rtemp;<BR>
end<BR>
Req = 1 / Req;<BR>
<BR>
Let's take a look at this program. The <I> function</I> keyword is there, our output variable is Req, and our input variable is the vector, R, and the name of this function is parallel. The <I> no_of_elements</I> variable will then store how long the vector is. You can do this by typing in <I>length(vector)</I> where vector is a standard vector you declare in either the M-File or in the command line window where you pass it to this function. We set Req equal to 0 since this will be accumulating and adding up all the resistor values. We first, take the inverse of each value read in from the lower bound of 1 to the higher bound, no_of_elements, and then invert them all, and add them to the total. Once this is done, we then invert the total which was accumulated in the for loop and that is our answer.<BR>
<BR>
Supposing we use the vector R, which represents our resistors in parallel. We would then invoke the command <I>parallel</I> and use R as input. So it would look like this<BR>
<BR>
>> parallel(R)<BR>
<BR>
ans =<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.8502<BR>
<BR>
We could also implement this with a while statement<BR>
<BR>
function [Req] = parallel(R)<BR>
no_of_elements = length(R);<BR>
Req = 0;<BR>
i = 1;<BR>
while i <= no_of_elements<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspRtemp = 1 / R(i);<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspReq = Req + Rtemp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp i = i + 1;<BR>
end<BR>
Req = 1 / Req;<BR>
<BR>
Verify this and you will get the same answer as using the for implementation.<BR>
<BR>
That's it! You've made it through the tutorial. Thanks for reading this MATLAB Tutorial. Check out the rest of the IEEE website when you have time. Happy Programming.<BR>
